# Weather-Web-Visualisation-Dashboard
This project was from Monash University's data analysis course. This project's goal was to create a web page that displayed a summary of the relationships between latitude and a number of other weather based vairables from the included dataset (cities.csv or data.html). There is also a python notebook file to convert cities.csv to an html document. The html document is also live on github.io.
